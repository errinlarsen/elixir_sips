Notes
=====

* What is "the actor model"?
* List of links needed:
  * [Erlang page](http://www.erlang.org/)
  * Maybe a link directly to the Erlang [downloads
    page](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/downloads/download-erlang-otp)?
  * [Elixir page](http://elixir-lang.org/)
  * Maybe a link directly to the Elixir [downloads
    page](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/tags)?
* There is some annoying ambient noise during the video
* Should mention that there are Homebrew packages available for Erlang and
  Elixir for us Mac users (also, other Distributions are available as well)
  * `brew install elixir` is broken
  * I used `brew edit elixir` and followed [this commit's
    changes](https://github.com/Jell/homebrew/commit/b6f8c3b34f511725585a54b8b4709019c4d8821b)
    to fix the problem
* Windows user's should look at the [precompiled
  package](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/releases/)
